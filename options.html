<h1>Heed</h1>
<p>
  <strong>Block Heed</strong> is a simple way to block access to time-consuming websites (like during the working hours) as you specify in the window below.<br><br>
  Type the sites you would like to block the access to in a format like <strong>facebook.com</strong>, type them in new line each.
  Sites will be blocked on their next attempted visit if enabled. With the same said, you can also enjoy music in the background to increase focus.
  <br>
  Say no to distractions, and pay <b>heed</b>!
